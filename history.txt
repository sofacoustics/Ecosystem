*** Ecosystem ***

To be done:
* Ask JW: DatabasePolicy.php: what's the difference between ?User and User
* Ask JW: Is Spatie used for permissions?
* Clarify with JW how to add "Admin" as a role to User table. Admins should be able to see and edit all data.
* Add confirmation on delete (JW)
* Prepare metadata for RADAR
* Implement Docs = documentation files to be linked with tools and/or databases.
* Implement Link of a database to a doc file (in RADAR via RelatedIdentifier)
* Implement RelatedIdentifier to store citations of databases?
* Define download (single file, bulk)
* Implement the most important widgets
* Implement the actual procedure to "Assign DOI"
* Implement the actual procedure to "Publish with DOI"
* Landing page: Include filter by Visible and DOI
* Bulk Upload: Cancel an upload
* Bulk Upload: Warn if a dataset already exists
* Think about how to implement all the database functionality for tools

Nice to have: 
* Layout: Show buttons as tabs
* Trim spaces from the inputs
* Add "Fill in with your name" at creators, publishers, and rightsholders.
* Fork to a SONICOM Github repository. PM: I tried that, but it is more complex than I thought. Skipped for later. 
* Audio View: add https://wavesurfer.xyz/
* Bulk Upload: Automatic fill of the dataset description



DONE!
=====

Database
==================

* General check of the RADAR API
* Retrieval of all databases from datathek

* Bulk Upload: Provide option to select datasets for the upload


User profile:
=============
