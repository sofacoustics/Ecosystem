*** Ecosystem ***

To be done before we go live:
* JW: Implement the minimal procedure to "Assign DOI"
* PM: Implement the actual procedure to "assign DOI"
* JW: Implement the minimal procedure to "Publish with DOI"
* PM: Implement the actual procedure to "Publish with DOI"
* JW: Add obligatory email confirmation when a user registers
* PM: Implement Metadata for Tools (use polymorphic [one-to-many] relations)
* PM: Migrate and publish the repo
* JW/PM: Workflow for the test and live server
* Implement a way to link documentation files with databases (in RADAR via RelatedIdentifier)
* Implement RelatedIdentifier to store citations of databases
* MM: Implement the most important widgets

To be done after we go live: 
* JW: Add "Admin" as a role to the User interface. Admins should be able to see and edit all data
* JW: Clean up the User related code
* Bulk Upload: Cancel an upload
* JW: Clean up the Code in the repo

Nice to have: 
* Layout: Show buttons as tabs
* Trim spaces from the inputs
* Add "Fill in with your name" at creators, publishers, and rightsholders.
* Fork to a SONICOM Github repository. PM: I tried that, but it is more complex than I thought. Skipped for later. 
* Audio View: add https://wavesurfer.xyz/
* Bulk Upload: Automatic fill of the dataset description
* Add confirmation on delete
* Show comments as a table
* Landing page: Include filter by Visible and Archived
* Bulk Upload: Warn if a dataset already exists


DONE!
=====

Tools
=====
* Index table implemented

Download
========

* General interface created
* JSON format created
* Example client for Matlab/Octave implemented
* Download of the database list implemented
* Example client to display database list for Matlab/Octave implemented


Widgets & Services
=======

* Implement the seeder tables for various widgets and services
* Image: rotation and reset (container does not expand yet)
* Audio: basic player
* Properties: file size, internal path, date created, data updated


Comments
========

* show, delete, new, edit

Datasets definition
===================

* New, Show, Delete, Edit
* Widgets generally implemented
* Multiple photos as a single datafile: user needs to create animated WEBP
* "Non-spatial data (SOFA)" added
* Definitions as a table
* "Description" added to the Definition of each Datasetfile.
* Check for unique definition names in a database (important for the download!)
* Definition name must not contain <>:&"\|?*/



Database
==================

* General check of the RADAR API
* Retrieval of all databases from datathek
* show and edit "Visible", "Assign DOI", "Publish with DOI"
* Fake procedure to "Assign DOI"
* Fake procedure for "Publish with DOI"


Database landing page
=====================

Done: 
* General implementation
* Include Publication and Production Date for sorting
* Include Last Modified for sorting
* Include Visible for sorting

Upload & Datasets
=================

Done: 
* Upload (create a new dataset, edit an existing)
* Check for unique dataset names in a database (important for the download!)
* Dataset Name must not contain <>:&"\|?*/

Bulk upload
===========

Done: 
* Check if a dataset already exists
* Implement the actual Upload
* Dataset name and datafile names linked by <ID>
* Support for wildcard by <ANY> 
* Brief statistics
* Table
* Check if duplicate files assigned to the same datafile
* Provide option to select datasets for the upload
* Bug fix: not being able to bulk upload datasets which names already exist



User profile:
=============

* "ORCID" added. Syntax: String, max 20 characters. 
* Link the profile with ORCID
* Allow new databases only if the profile linked with ORCID
