Landing page
============
* Latest Database, Tool, and Datafile shown


Tools
=====
* Index table implemented
* Show, Edit, Upload, Download implemented
* Metadata for Tools implemented (using polymorphic [one-to-many] relations)
* Subject Areas removed from the interface
* Publication Year: removed from the interface. Set default to "unknown"
* Language: removed from the interface. Set default to "eng". 
* Resource: called "Type", implemented the selection of “Model”, “Physical Object”, “Software”, “Text”, and “Other” 
* Additional Title: fixed to Subtitle, if available, shown in the header
* Dependency of Database functions removed
* Descriptions are now resizeable multiline entries: General (=RADAR: Other), Abstract, Method, and Technical Remarks. 
* Order of the metadata edits rearranged, display of metadata harmonized
* Input parameter checks added
* Table touched on adding/editing of child elements
* Tools index page: search by Title, Produced Year, Keywords, Type.
* The actual procedure to "Publish with DOI" implemented, however without data upload yet. 

Download
========
* General interface created
* JSON format created
* Example client for Matlab/Octave implemented
* Download of the database list implemented
* Example clients for Python implemented
* Example clients to display database list for Matlab/Octave implemented

Widgets & Services
==================
* Seeder tables for various widgets and services implemented
* Image: rotation and reset (container does not expand yet)
* Audio: basic player
* Properties: file size, internal path, date created, data updated
* SOFA Properties: Table with all metadata
* STL Viewer: https://www.viewstl.com/plugin/

Comments
========
* show, delete, new, edit
* Input parameter checks added

Datasets definition
===================
* New, Show, Delete, Edit
* Widgets generally implemented
* Multiple photos as a single datafile: user needs to create animated WEBP
* "Non-spatial data (SOFA)" added
* Definitions as a table
* "Description" added to the Definition of each Datasetfile.
* Check for unique definition names in a database (important for the download!)
* Definition name must not contain <>:&"\|?*/
* Input parameter checks added

Database
========
* General check of the RADAR API
* Retrieval of all databases from datathek
* show and edit "Visible", "Assign DOI", "Publish with DOI"
* Fake procedure to "Assign DOI"
* Fake procedure for "Publish with DOI"
* Adapted for metadata working with Tools
* DOI: when available, displayed in the header
* Subject Areas removed from the interface
* Publication Year: removed from the interface. Set default to "unknown"
* Language: removed from the interface. Set default to "eng". 
* Resource: called Resource Type and fixed to "Dataset" with the remark "SONICOM Ecosystem". 
* Additional Title: fixed to Subtitle, if available, shown in the header
* Descriptions are now resizeable multiline entries: General (=RADAR: Other), Abstract, Method, and Technical Remarks. 
* Order of the metadata edits rearranged, display of metadata harmonized
* Input parameter checks added
* Table touched on adding/editing of child elements
* Index page: harmonized and implemented DOI and visible icons.
* Index page: Search by Keywords and sorting by DOI.
* Actual procedure to "assign DOI" implemented
* Related identifiers added when submitted to RADAR
* DOI can be revokoed (=delete the entry at RADAR).
* Data upload on "Publish with DOI" implemented. 
* "Publish with DOI" from the user's perspective ready.

Database landing page
=====================
* General implementation
* Include Publication and Production Date for sorting
* Include Last Modified for sorting
* Include Visible for sorting

Upload & Datasets
=================
* Upload (create a new dataset, edit an existing)
* Check for unique dataset names in a database (important for the download!)
* Dataset Name must not contain <>:&"\|?*/
* Input parameter checks added

Bulk upload
===========
* Check if a dataset already exists
* Implement the actual Upload
* Dataset name and datafile names linked by <ID>
* Support for wildcard by <ANY> 
* Brief statistics
* Table
* Check if duplicate files assigned to the same datafile
* Provide option to select datasets for the upload
* Bug fix: not being able to bulk upload datasets which names already exist

User profile
============
* "ORCID" added. Syntax: String, max 20 characters. 
* Link the profile with ORCID
* Allow new databases only if the profile linked with ORCID

Metadata status
===============
* Title: done.
* ProductionYear: done. Input checked for YYYY, YYYY-YYYY, or "unknown" (case insensitive).
* Resource (& resourceType): done. In the database form, set to "Dataset" and "Sonicom Ecosystem", non-editable. In the tool form, choice of selected types only. 
* Language: done. Removed from the interface because fixed to "eng". 
* Additional Title (& additionalTitleType): done as 0-1. In the forms, fixed to "Subtitle". 
* PublicationYear: done. Remove from the interface because should be set by RADAR.
