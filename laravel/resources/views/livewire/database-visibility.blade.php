<h3>DOI Assignment:</h3>

    <p>By clicking the button below, a DOI can be assigned to your database.</p>
    <p>To this end, the following steps will happen:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Your database will be registered at the Ã–AW Datathek as a new "dataset".
            <li>The database metadata will be sent to the Datathek. This is a quick process.
            <li>A DOI for your database will be requested and assigned to your database within the Ecosystem.
        </ul>
        <p>Once a DOI has been assigned, the DOI will be a permanent part of your database.</p>
        <p><b>This operation is irreversible!</b></p>

    <p>Note that this does not publish your database with that DOI yet:
        The datafiles will <b>not</b> be transfered to the Datathek yet, and the link between the DOI and your data will be invalid yet.</p>
    <p>Note also that even with DOI assigned, you will be able to hide your database within the Ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Persistent Publication:</h3>

            <p>By clicking the button below, your database can be submitted to be persistently published with the DOI.</p>
            <p>To this end, the following steps will be taken:</p>

                <li>The database will be set to be locked. No edits will be allowed.
                <li>The metadata at the Datathek will be updated.
                <li>The datafiles will be sent to the Datathek. Depending on the size of your datafiles, this might take a while.
                <li>The curator of the Datathek will be notified.
